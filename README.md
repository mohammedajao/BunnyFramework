# About
Bunny is a framework, or currently a library, that offers event decoupling and a rudimentary CAD (Context-Aware Dialogue) system for Unity games.
In the future, I hope to clean up the code and have it easier to use.

The Bunny folder holds the framework.
Other code in this repository is from others as I initially was building this framework for another project.

Similar can be said for sprites & animations. 

In simplest terms, one can say that the only things of ownership here is the Bunny framework. Everything else can be credited to others.
